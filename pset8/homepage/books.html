        <p class="game-p">Jason has a problem. He doesn’t remember anything before waking up on a school bus holding hands with a girl.
        Apparently she’s his girlfriend Piper, his best friend is a kid named Leo, and they’re all students in the Wilderness School,
        a boarding school for “bad kids.” What he did to end up here, Jason has no idea—except that everything seems very wrong.

        <p class="game-p">In The Lost Hero, three demigods named Jason, Piper, and Leo made their first visit to Camp Half-Blood, where they inherited a blood-chilling quest:
        <br>
        Seven half-bloods shall answer the call,<br>
        To storm or fire the world must fall. <br>
        An oath to keep with a final breath, <br>
        And foes bear arms to the Doors of Death. <br>
        <br>
        Who are the other four mentioned in the prophecy? The answer may lie in another camp miles away, where a new camper has shown up and appears to be the son of Neptune, god of the sea…
        <br>
        With an ever-expanding cast of brave-hearted heroes and formidable foes, this second book in The Heroes of Olympus series offers all of the action, pathos, and humor that Rick Riordan fans crave.</p>

        <p class="game-p">Annabeth is terrified. Just when she’s about to be reunited with Percy—after six months of being apart,
        thanks to Hera—it looks like Camp Jupiter is preparing for war. As Annabeth and her friends Jason, Piper, and Leo fly in on the Argo II,
        she can’t blame the Roman demigods for thinking the ship is a Greek weapon. With its steaming bronze dragon masthead, Leo’s fantastical
        creation doesn’t appear friendly. Annabeth hopes that the sight of their praetor Jason on deck will reassure the Romans that the visitors
        from Camp Half-Blood are coming in peace.

        <p class="game-p">At the conclusion of The Mark of Athena, Annabeth and Percy tumble into a pit leading straight to the Underworld.
        The other five demigods have to put aside their grief and follow Percy’s instructions to find the mortal side of the Doors of Death.
        If they can fight their way through the Gaea’s forces, and Percy and Annabeth can survive the House of Hades, then the Seven will be
        able to seal the Doors both sides and prevent the giants from raising Gaea. But, Leo wonders, if the Doors are sealed, how will Percy
        and Annabeth be able to escape?
