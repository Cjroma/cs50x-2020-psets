        <p class="game-p"><strong>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS: GO)</strong> expands upon the team-based action gameplay that it pioneered when it was launched 19 years ago.
          <br>
          <br>
          CS: GO features new maps, characters, weapons, and game modes, and delivers updated versions of the classic CS content (de_dust2, etc.).
          <br>
          Counter-Strike took the gaming industry by surprise when the unlikely MOD became the most played online PC action game in the world almost
          immediately after its release in August 1999," said Doug Lombardi at Valve. "For the past 12 years, it has continued to be one of the most-played
          games in the world, headline competitive gaming tournaments and selling over 25 million units worldwide across the franchise. CS: GO promises to expand
          on CS' award-winning gameplay and deliver it to gamers on the PC as well as the next gen consoles and the Mac. . .<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_Global_Offensive/" target="_blank">Read more</a></p>
